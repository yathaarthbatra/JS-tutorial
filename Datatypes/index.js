//DataTypes in JS:
//By default when we declare the variables:
var a; //a is undefined
var b = null; //b is null
b = 5; //hence null value can be changed
console.log(b);

//if we want like : "my name is "yathaarth" "

var name = 'My name is "yathaarth"';
console.log(name); //output: My name is "Yathaarth"

//different data types:
//1. Numeric-->integer,double
//2. string

//to know the data type of the variable:
console.log(typeof b); //it tellls the data type of b

//operators are same as any other programming language
// + is used to concatenate two strings or string and numeric
